## Introduction

## Methods

### Data Acquisition

Data was obtained from the Center for Disease Control. Data for the 2018
National Immunization Survey Child Data was downloaded, including the
Dataset, R Input Statements, and Data User’s Guide (DHHS, 2020). The
Dataset file includes the full data from each participant in the survey.
The R Input Statements file includes code to appropriately label the
data in the Dataset file (Harrell, 2020). The Data User’s Guide provides
an explanation how the data was obtained and the meaning of each
variable in the dataset.

### Data Preparation

Data was extracted using the filter function to select variables
involving socioeconomic status and vaccination status (Wickham, 2019).
