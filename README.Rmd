## Abstract

## Introduction

## Methods
### Data Acquisition
This project used R Version 4.0.3 and R Studio Version 1.3.1093 (R Core Team, 2020; R Studio Team, 2020). Data was obtained from the Center for Disease Control. Data for the 2018 National Immunization Survey Child Data was downloaded, including the Dataset, R Input Statements, and Data User's Guide (DHHS, 2020). The Dataset file includes the full data from each participant in the survey. The R Input Statements file includes code to appropriately label the data in the Dataset file (Harrell, 2020). The Data User's Guide provides an explanation how the data was obtained and the meaning of each variable in the dataset.

### Data Preparation
Data was extracted using the filter function to select variables involving socioeconomic status and vaccination status (Wickham, 2019). Variables included were up-to-date status on the hepatitis B, rotavirus, haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcal conjugate, polio, influenza, MMR, and heptatitis A vaccines, as well as household income group, poverty status, and income to poverty ratio.
